# Gradient Descent Visualization
It is a Python project.  
  
This project is just to verify and visualize the concept "Simultaneous Update of Parameter in Gradient Descent" delivered by Andrew Ng in his lecture:
-Coursera  
-Course: Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
-Week 2: Logistic Regression As A Deep Neural Network  
-Video: Gradient Descent  
  
Concept is discussed in image: Capture-1.png and Capture-2.png
